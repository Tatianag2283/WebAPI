This example shows how to receive and process Integration Events.

To get started:

1. Load the Examples.sln into Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 (The .NET Framework 4.5 is required).  
2. In Visual Studio, right-click on "Example2" and select "Set as StartUp Project".  
3. Open `Program.cs` and change the `Username`, `Password` and `Account` constants to match your TeamHaven login credentials.  
4. Start the program running. A blank console window will be displayed.  
5. Open the TeamHaven Website, find an already completed Call, open the Call for update and then save it (it is not necessary to change any answers).  
6. You should see a message in the console window notifying you that the Call was saved.
